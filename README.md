# Authentication and Role-based Permissions - Frontend

This project is an implementation of a user authentication system with role-based permissions using React, Redux, and a backend API. Users are assigned different roles (admin, user) with varying levels of access. The project includes protected routes and ensures that the appropriate UI is shown based on user roles.

This is the frontend part of the Authentication and Role-based Permissions project. It's developed using React and Redux.
